# Base Registry

Base Registry is a Next.js application bootstrapped with create-next-app, designed to provide a modern web interface for blockchain registry management.

## Getting Started

To begin development, start the local development server using your preferred package manager. You may use npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun to run the development command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the application. The development environment supports hot module replacement, allowing you to see changes in real time as you modify the source code.

The main application entry point is located at `app/page.tsx`. Any modifications to this file will automatically trigger a page refresh in your browser.

This project leverages the next/font package to automatically optimize and load Geist, a modern font family developed by Vercel. This optimization ensures improved performance and consistent typography across the application.

## Learning Resources

For developers new to Next.js or seeking to deepen their understanding of the framework, comprehensive documentation is available through the official Next.js Documentation at https://nextjs.org/docs. This resource covers all framework features and API references in detail.

Additionally, an interactive tutorial is available at https://nextjs.org/learn, providing hands-on experience with Next.js concepts and best practices.

The Next.js project is open source and actively maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/vercel/next.js. Community feedback and contributions are encouraged and welcomed.

## Deployment

The recommended deployment platform for Next.js applications is Vercel, created by the same team that develops Next.js. Vercel provides seamless integration and optimized hosting for Next.js projects.

To deploy your application, visit https://vercel.com/new and select your repository. The platform will automatically detect the Next.js framework and configure the appropriate build settings.

For detailed information about deployment options, configuration, and best practices, consult the Next.js deployment documentation at https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying.
